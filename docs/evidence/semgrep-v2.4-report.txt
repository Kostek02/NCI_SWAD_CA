          Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string.
          This is usually bad practice because manual construction    
          could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker   
          could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the
          database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is       
          available by default in most database engines.              
          Alternatively, consider using an object-relational mapper   
          (ORM) such as SQLAlchemy which will protect your queries.
