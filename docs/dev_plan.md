# Secure Notes Web Application – Development Plan

**Author:** Konstanty Litwinow  
**Programme:** MSc Cybersecurity (National College of Ireland)  
**Module:** Secure Web Development (H9SWD)  
**Assessment:** CA2 – Secure Web Application  
**Framework:** Flask (Python 3.12)  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/Kostek02/CA2](https://github.com/Kostek02/CA2)

## 1. Overview

This development plan defines the structured, secure, and traceable approach used to build the **Secure Notes Web Application**.  
The project follows a practical **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**, evolving from an intentionally insecure baseline to a hardened, production-ready system.

All development, documentation, and version control are performed through Git using a transparent, multi-phase workflow supported by meaningful commit messages, evidence screenshots, and version tags.

---

## 2. Development Methodology

The project applies an **iterative and incremental** SSDLC process with continuous feedback and validation:

1. **Planning & Requirements Definition** – establish system and security requirements (see `prd.md`).
2. **Design & Scaffold** – create Flask foundation, configuration, and environment scripts.
3. **Implementation** – develop functional and insecure builds.
4. **Testing & Analysis** – perform static/dynamic analysis with Bandit, Semgrep, and pytest.
5. **Hardening & Refactor** – mitigate vulnerabilities using secure design principles and Flask libraries.
6. **Verification & Documentation** – validate controls, record evidence, and finalise deliverables.

Each iteration strengthens both code functionality and security posture.

## 3. Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **main** | Stable branch containing only verified and tagged releases (v0.0 → v2.6). |
| **dev** | Active development branch used for all implementation, testing, and incremental commits. |

Both are mirrored remotely as **origin/main** and **origin/dev** on GitHub to provide full visibility.

**Workflow Summary**
1. Development occurs exclusively in `dev`.  
2. Milestone completion triggers a merge into `main`.  
3. Each merge includes a tag (e.g., `v0.1-setup`, `v1.0-insecure`, `v2.0-secure`).  
4. Internal evidence and environment files remain excluded via `.gitignore`.

This approach ensures clear traceability and meets CA2’s requirement for **visible progressive commit history**.

## 5. Secure Coding and Testing Approach

### 5.1 Static Analysis
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Bandit** | Detects common Python security issues (e.g., unsafe functions, weak cryptography). |
| **Semgrep** | Applies OWASP Top 10 rule sets to identify framework-level weaknesses. |
| **Flake8** | Enforces PEP 8 compliance and code quality. |

### 5.2 Dynamic & Functional Testing
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **pytest** | Automates route, authentication, and CRUD verification. |
| **Manual testing** | Confirms runtime behaviour of mitigations (CSRF tokens, secure cookies, access control). |

### 5.3 Security Verification
Validation checkpoints include:
- Presence of CSRF tokens in all forms.  
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt (verified in database).  
- Secure headers (`CSP`, `HSTS`, `X-Frame-Options`) visible in browser inspector.  
- IDOR/SQLi attempts correctly denied with `403 Forbidden`.

## 6. Documentation and Evidence Management

All documentation resides under `/docs/` and `/docs/evidence/`.

| Artifact | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **prd.md** | Defines functional and security requirements. |
| **dev_plan.md** | Defines project roadmap and branching model. |
| **/docs/evidence/** | Screenshots, Bandit/Semgrep outputs, pytest logs, version proofs. |
| **README.md** | High-level overview for public repository. |
| **Internal Notes** | Non-public drafts and internal planning materials (excluded from repo). |

Evidence is collected after each tagged milestone to provide a chronological proof of progress and security improvement.

---

## 7. OWASP 2025 Integration

Each refactor phase (v2.0–v2.3) directly addresses **OWASP Top 10 (2025)** categories:

| OWASP Category | Implemented Controls |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **A01 – Broken Access Control** | RBAC, per-record ownership validation. |
| **A02 – Security Misconfiguration** | `.env`-based configuration, Flask-Talisman, disabled debug mode. |
| **A04 – Cryptographic Failures** | bcrypt password hashing, secure session cookies. |
| **A05 – Injection** | Parameterised queries, sanitised templates. |
| **A07 – Authentication Failures** | Flask-Login session management and validation. |
| **A09 – Logging & Alerting Failures** | Audit logging of authentication and CRUD actions. |
| **A10 – Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** | Custom error handlers for 403/404/500 responses. |

---

## 8. Success Metrics

1. **Security Compliance** – all SR1–SR9 requirements verified.  
2. **Functional Completeness** – FR1–FR7 successfully implemented.  
3. **Testing Coverage** – pytest ≥ 80% route coverage.  
4. **Auditability** – consistent commit history and tagging.  
5. **Quality Assurance** – zero high-severity Bandit/Semgrep findings by final release.
