Admin blueprint for the Secure Notes App.

Purpose:
- Handles administrative views for managing users and notes.
- Shows all users and notes in the system.

v0.9.3: Functional baseline - INTENTIONALLY INSECURE
- Uses string concatenation for SQL queries (SQL injection vulnerable)
- No access control - anyone can access admin route (will be fixed in v2.2.1)
- Shows plaintext passwords (demonstrates vulnerability)
- No RBAC - no role-based restrictions
